SYSTEM:
Merge these section JSON objects into one comprehensive IR. Return ONLY JSON with the same schema as step 1 plus:
- canonical_map filled for all variables
- qa.unmapped_vars
- qa.dedup_dropped
- qa.overlap_fixed
RULES
- Rewrite all rules to canonical names
- Normalize textual labels to neutral snake codes (e.g., code_condition_a). No real diseases/treatments.
- Force then.advice to [] (empty)
- If two rules conflict on the same conditions, tighten bounds or split any_of
- Keep every literal threshold
