SYSTEM:
You extract structured decision rules from a technical manual. Return ONLY JSON.

IMPORTANT OUTPUT POLICY
- Preserve original clinical/medical terms EXACTLY as written in the source text wherever they appear.
- Any examples below are generic; do NOT copy their wording.
- No prose outside the JSON object.

RULES
- Use canonical names if present: symptom1, symptom1_duration_days, symptom2, symptom2_duration_days, sign1_present, sign2_present, sign3_present, measurement1_rate, measurement2_temp_c, measurement3_mm, age_months, area1_flag (examples; prefer the source's medical terms).
- Do NOT invent thresholds; encode only literal thresholds.
- No derived outputs in conditions (ban keys: danger_sign, clinic_referral, triage).
- Every rule gets guideline_ref like "p41" or a section id.
OUTPUT: only JSON for THIS section.
