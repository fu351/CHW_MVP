RULES
- Use canonical names if present: symptom1, symptom1_duration_days, symptom2, symptom2_duration_days, sign1_present, sign2_present, sign3_present, measurement1_rate, measurement2_temp_c, measurement3_mm, age_months, area1_flag (examples; prefer the source's medical terms).
- Do NOT invent thresholds; encode only literal thresholds.
- No derived outputs in conditions (ban keys: danger_sign, clinic_referral, triage).
- Every rule gets guideline_ref like "p41" or a section id.
OUTPUT: only JSON for THIS section.

Sick children need treatment quickly. Begin treatment before the child leaves, if the child can
[PAGE 65]
drink.
[PAGE 65]
Help the caregiver give the first dose in front of you. This way you can be sure that the
[PAGE 65]
treatment starts as soon as possible, and that the caregiver knows how to give it correctly.
[PAGE 65]
Then ask the caregiver to give the child the rest of the medicine at home.
[PAGE 65]
The child you refer to a health facility should also receive the first dose, if the child can drink.
[PAGE 65]
It takes time to go to the health facility. The child may have to wait to receive treatment there.
[PAGE 65]
In the meantime, the first dose of the medicine starts to work.
[PAGE 65]
This section presents:
[PAGE 65]

[PAGE 65]
the child one dose, and help the mother to do this.
[PAGE 65]
