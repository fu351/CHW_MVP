## Development Timeline

### Phase 1: Initial Setup & Basic Infrastructure
**Prompt 1**: *"Look through every file and get an understanding of what has been built so far. In the next prompt i'll give you my mvp build plan, I want you to pick up wheerver it was left off at at your own discretion"*

**Analysis**: Discovered existing but incomplete codebase with basic CLI structure.

**Prompt 2**: *"You are writing code. Build a fully offline, sandboxed CLI MVP for "ChatCHW v0.1" in Python..."*

**Major Changes**:
- Created complete project structure with `pyproject.toml`
- Implemented core modules: `schema.py`, `rules_loader.py`, `engine.py`
- Built initial BPMN/DMN builders with basic linear workflows
- Added CSV export and visualization capabilities
- Set up comprehensive `.gitignore`

**Results**: 
- ✅ Basic CLI framework operational
- ✅ Rule evaluation engine working
- ✅ Simple BPMN/DMN generation
- ❌ Linear workflow (not clinically appropriate)

### Phase 2: Repository Structure & Error Fixes
**Prompt 3**: *"stop generating code in the chatm shouldn't all of this be going into the files . But before anything else give me a summary of your action plan for me to double check"*

**Major Changes**:
- Fixed file path errors (`chatchw/chatchw/rules` → `chatchw/rules`)
- Corrected CLI command execution context
- Updated dependency versions to resolve conflicts

**Results**:
- ✅ Commands execute from correct directory
- ✅ Dependencies install successfully
- ✅ Basic workflow operational

### Phase 3: PDF Processing Pipeline
**Prompt 4**: *"adjust my workflow however needed. If i were to input the who chw pdf i want a bpmn and dmn to be generated from it"*

**Major Changes**:
- Added `pypdf` for PDF text extraction
- Created `CHWRuleExtractor` with regex-based rule parsing
- Implemented PDF-to-BPMN/DMN pipeline
- Added new CLI commands: `extract-pdf`, `pdf-to-bpmn`, `pdf-to-dmn`, `pdf-workflow`

**Results**:
- ✅ PDF text extraction working
- ✅ Regex-based rule extraction operational
- ✅ End-to-end PDF pipeline functional
- ⚠️ Limited rule extraction accuracy with regex

### Phase 4: Generalized Testing & Validation
**Prompt 5**: *"do you need to make new tests? can't there be generalised tests that do the structural tests of the bpmn and dmn?"*

**Major Changes**:
- Created `test_any_artifacts.py` for generalized BPMN/DMN testing
- Implemented structural validation for BPMN elements
- Added DMN decision table validation
- Fixed BPMN builder issues (gateway completeness)

**Results**:
- ✅ Generalized testing framework
- ❌ BPMN gateway validation failures
- ❌ DMN parsing issues

### Phase 5: BPMN/DMN Architecture Redesign
**Error Resolution**: Multiple gateway and parsing failures led to major architectural changes.

**Major Changes**:
- **BPMN Refactor**: Redesigned from linear to sequential clinical workflow
  - Start → Collect Patient Info → Assess Danger Signs → Danger Gateway
  - Added proper UserTasks and BusinessRuleTasks with DMN linkage
  - Implemented conditional flows with `conditionExpression`
  - Added default flows on exclusive gateways
- **DMN Refactor**: Upgraded to DMN 1.4 with hierarchical decisions
  - Separated danger signs (priority 100+) from clinical assessment
  - Added proper input variables with `typeRef`
  - Implemented FEEL expression mapping
  - Fixed namespace and conformance declarations

**Results**:
- ✅ Clinically appropriate sequential workflow
- ✅ BPMN/DMN structural validation passing
- ✅ Proper standards compliance (DMN 1.4, BPMN 2.0)

### Phase 6: Enhanced Rule Extraction & Flowcharts
**Prompt 6**: *"OK now I want you to build a CLI chatbot that takes a BPMN and DMN as input for it's chat logic..."*

**Major Changes**:
- Added OpenAI integration for intelligent rule extraction
- Created `OpenAIRuleExtractor` with validation and cleaning

- Added BPMN/DMN to readable JSON conversion
- Built modular chatbot architecture with conversation state management

**Results**:
- ✅ AI-enhanced rule extraction (much higher accuracy)
- ✅ Beautiful clinical flowcharts replace PDF guides
- ✅ Technical flowcharts for development
- ✅ Modular chatbot framework ready

### Phase 7: Interactive Chatbot Implementation
**Prompt 7**: *"Awesome give me the command to demo the chatbot and let me test it"*

**Major Changes**:
- Implemented `ChatbotEngine` with BPMN/DMN parsing
- Created conversation flow management
- Added input validation and re-asking logic
- Built session saving and clinical reasoning

**Initial Issues**:
- Chatbot not waiting for input
- No diagnosis output
- "Hallucinating" findings from single inputs

### Phase 8: Chatbot Logic Refinement
**Prompt 8**: *"It's not waiting for the human input or anything"*
**Prompt 9**: *"Your hallucinating i only answered the temperature question but it's suddnely finding connexctions to everything else..."*

**Major Changes**:
- Fixed DMN parser to handle nested `<dmn:text>` elements
- Redesigned `get_next_question` for sequential clinical workflow
- Implemented `_filter_most_specific_rules` to prevent hallucination
- Added robust input validation with type checking
- Fixed DMN output parsing for comma-separated effects
- Added BPMN/DMN alignment flags for gateway routing

**Results**:
- ✅ Sequential question flow (danger signs → clinical assessment)
- ✅ Proper diagnosis output with reasoning
- ✅ Robust input handling (accepts 1/0 for yes/no)
- ✅ No more hallucinated findings
- ✅ Clinical recommendations align with decision logic

### Phase 9: Comprehensive Validation Framework
**Prompt 10**: *"Use the dmn and bpmn validation code ... then ensure that that all encodings and tags across the bpmn matches the dmn using validate alignment"*

**Major Changes**:
- Created `validator.py` with comprehensive BPMN/DMN checks
- Implemented structural soundness tests (start/end events, reachability, orphans)
- Added logical completeness tests (DMN consistency, hit policy compliance)
- Built cross-validation for BPMN/DMN alignment
- Added `validate-artifacts` CLI command

**Results**:
- ✅ Comprehensive validation covering all standards requirements
- ✅ BPMN structural soundness verified
- ✅ DMN logical consistency confirmed
- ✅ Cross-artifact alignment validated

### Phase 10: Final Integration & Testing
**Prompt 11**: *"Run the new chatbot with the new bpmn and dmn for me to test out"*

**Final Test Results** (with `openai_output_v4_fixed`):
- ✅ **Sequential Clinical Workflow**: Danger signs → Clinical assessment
- ✅ **Danger Sign Detection**: Convulsions correctly triggered hospital referral
- ✅ **Input Validation**: Invalid inputs (letters for numbers) properly handled
- ✅ **Clinical Context**: Questions have emojis and clear medical descriptions
- ✅ **Standards Compliance**: BPMN 2.0 and DMN 1.4 fully compliant
- ✅ **Conversation Flow**: Natural progression through medical assessment
- ✅ **Decision Logic**: Proper triage to hospital/clinic/home based on findings

## Recent Updates (Sep 11, 2025)

- OpenAI extractor (refined) upgraded to prompt v2.1
  - Rule extraction now canonicalizes variables (temperature_c, resp_rate, age_months, muac_mm, etc.), keeps ALL rules, and returns:
    - canonical_map.json, qa_report.json, ask_plan.json
  - Modular DMN/BPMN generation (two-call) with no subsetting and typed outputs per module; aggregator uses boolean precedence (no string parsing)
  - Guardrails: strip circular inputs (danger_sign/clinic_referral) before DMN prompt; FEEL only (=, !=, <, <=, >, >=, true/false)
  - New methods: `generate_modular_dmn_package`, `generate_bpmn_from_modular`

- Dynamic chatbot engine
  - Canonical variable `diarrhea` used; duplicates removed; follow-ups gated on primary booleans
  - DMN integration prefers typed outputs: `triage` (str), `danger_sign` (bool), `clinic_referral` (bool), `reason` (str), `ref` (str); legacy `effect` parsing kept as fallback
  - Hardened BPMN condition evaluation for `danger_sign` / `clinic_referral` (tolerant spacing/case and bare identifiers)
  - DMN parsing fixed to use `DMNParser.parse_dmn_file` (DMN 1.4 namespace)

- CLI
  - New: `generate-modular-bpmn-dmn` → modular DMN package + BPMN generation
  - Enhanced: `chat-dynamic` runs the BPMN-driven chatbot with detailed reasoning

- Latest artifacts
  - Extracted rules (latest): `refined_who_chw_extracted.json`
  - Modular outputs (v5):
    - `modular_artifacts_5/who_chw_modular5_modular.dmn`
    - `modular_artifacts_5/who_chw_modular5_workflow.bpmn`
    - `modular_artifacts_5/who_chw_modular5_canonical_map.json`
    - `modular_artifacts_5/who_chw_modular5_ask_plan.json`
    - `modular_artifacts_5/who_chw_modular5_qa_report.json`

- Regeneration commands
  - Extract rules (refined):
    ```powershell
    python -m chatchw.cli extract-pdf-refined --pdf "../WHO CHW guide 2012.pdf" --output "../refined_who_chw_extracted.json" --module "WHO_CHW_Refined5"
    ```
  - Generate modular DMN package + BPMN:
    ```powershell
    python -m chatchw.cli generate-modular-bpmn-dmn --rules "../refined_who_chw_extracted.json" --output-dir "../modular_artifacts_5" --module "WHO_CHW_Modular5" --who-pdf "../WHO CHW guide 2012.pdf"
    ```
  - Run dynamic chatbot:
    ```powershell
    python -m chatchw.cli chat-dynamic --bpmn "../modular_artifacts_5/who_chw_modular5_workflow.bpmn" --dmn "../modular_artifacts_5/who_chw_modular5_modular.dmn" --session "dynamic_session_modular5.json"
    ```

- Known fixes addressed
  - Removed string `contains(...)` parsing of a single "effect"; DMN now uses typed columns and an explicit boolean aggregator
  - Restored core measurements (temperature_c, resp_rate, age_months, muac_mm) into canonical map and ask-plan
  - Eliminated duplicated diarrhea variables; chatbot no longer asks both `diarrhoea` and `diarrhea_present`
  - Stopped rule subsetting to avoid “always home” fall-through

## Architecture Evolution

### Initial Architecture (Linear)
```
Start → Task1 → Task2 → ... → TaskN → End
```
**Problems**: Not clinically appropriate, poor gateway structure

### Current Architecture (Sequential Clinical)
```
Start → Collect Patient Info → Assess Danger Signs → Danger Gateway
                                                           ↓
                                            [DANGER] → Hospital End
                                                           ↓
                                            [SAFE] → Collect Symptoms → Apply Clinical Rules → Triage Gateway
                                                                                                        ↓
                                                                                    [HOSPITAL/CLINIC/HOME] → Respective Ends
```
**Benefits**: Clinically sound, proper escalation, standards compliant

### Data Flow
```
PDF → OpenAI/Regex Extraction → Rules JSON → BPMN Builder → BPMN XML
                                           → DMN Builder → DMN XML
                                                         → Chatbot Engine → Clinical Consultation
```

## Recent Updates (Sep 12, 2025)

- Guarded 5-step extractor stabilized
  - Step 3 tolerant parser for DMN + ASK_PLAN with raw capture (`dmn_ask_debug_last.txt`) and XML sanitizer for `<dmn:text>` closures
  - Enforced modular DMN with typed outputs and explicit aggregator inputs; FIRST hit policy across modules
  - ASK_PLAN aligned to canonical names with gated follow-ups
- Refined extractor
  - Batched LLM merges with strict JSON and fail-fast; deterministic coalesce; ASK_PLAN vs DMN validator
  - BPMN generator updated to route by triage equality (aggregator)
- Dynamic chatbot engine
  - Loads ASK_PLAN and gates follow-ups; evaluates per-module decisions and short-circuits on danger_signs, then uses `aggregate_final`
  - Reads typed DMN outputs (`triage`, `danger_sign`, `clinic_referral`, `reason`, `ref`); no effect-string parsing
- Artifacts v6 (guarded)
  - Directory: `guarded_artifacts_6/`
  - Files: `who_chw_sections.json`, `who_chw_merged_ir.json`, `who_chw_dmn.dmn`, `who_chw_ask_plan.json`, `who_chw_workflow.bpmn`
  - Behavior verified:
    - MUAC 124 → Clinic
    - Bloody diarrhea → Clinic
    - High fever or prolonged fever → Clinic
    - Danger signs (e.g., convulsions) → Hospital (module-level; add BPMN task for questions in future)
- Validation note
  - Structural checks pass. Alignment check warns that BPMN expects `danger_sign`/`clinic_referral` flags while the validator currently detects flags only via legacy effect-strings. Runtime logic is correct; validator will be updated to read boolean output columns.

### Commands (dir 6)

```powershell
# Run guarded pipeline to dir 6
python -m chatchw.cli guarded-workflow --pdf "WHO CHW guide 2012.pdf" --module WHO_CHW --outdir guarded_artifacts_6

# Validate artifacts
python -m chatchw.cli validate-artifacts --bpmn .\guarded_artifacts_6\who_chw_workflow.bpmn --dmn .\guarded_artifacts_6\who_chw_dmn.dmn

# Chat with dynamic engine
python -m chatchw.cli chat-dynamic --bpmn .\guarded_artifacts_6\who_chw_workflow.bpmn --dmn .\guarded_artifacts_6\who_chw_dmn.dmn --session dynamic_session_guarded6.json
```
